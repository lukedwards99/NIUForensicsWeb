# NIUForensicsWeb

## About

This is the source code of the NIU Speech and Debate team's website. It was originally created by Lucas Edwards.

The custom bootstrap compliled css is located in css/main.min.css

## Setup

Since this is a static website with no need for server renderer we don't keep the node modules in the repo. This may need to change if the project become sufficently complex.

*** You dont need to do this setup if you aren't changing the bootstrap ***

1. First set up GitHub and clone the repository.

2. Install the node.js runtime [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Use the LTS version.

3. Initilize your repo with npm using:
    ```
    npm init
    ```

4. Install bootstrap with the command:

    ```
    npm install bootstrap
    ```

5. Install the Live Sass extension in VSCode to render the sass files 

The video tutorial used for set up can be found [here](https://youtu.be/nCX3QVl_PiI).

[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/) has great tutorials for Bootstrap in general.
