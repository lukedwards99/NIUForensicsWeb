                            Forensics is Latin for forensic meaning “to seek truth”.
                            Unlike forensic scientists who use dead bodies “to seek truth”, we seek truth
                            through spoken
                            work and through structured debate.
                            So, while we are technically the NIU Forensics Team we also call ourselves the
                            Speech and
                            Debate team for clarity's sake.
                            We compete in many different “events” like how a track meet works except.
                            Instead of doing the high-jump and the 100-meter sprint, you could do Impromptu
                            Speaking and
                            Persuasive Speaking.
