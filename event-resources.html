                        Interpretation events can be described as competitive acting.
                        Each event is 10 minutes long. Each of these events also includes what we call a “black book”.
                        The black book has your script within it, and it can be used as a prop.
                        We refer to this category of events as “interp”.

                        A program of thematically linked selections of literary merit, chosen from two or three
                        recognized genres of competitive interpretation (prose/poetry/drama). A primary focus of this
                        event should be on the development of the theme using narrative/story, language, and/or
                        characterization. A substantial portion of the total time must be devoted to each of the genres
                        used in the program. Different genre means the material must appear in separate pieces of
                        literature (e.g., A poem included in a short story that appears only in that short story does
                        not constitute a poetry genre.) Only one selection may be original. Use of manuscript is
                        required.

                        An original, humorous speech by the student, designed to exhibit sound speech composition,
                        thematic, coherence, direct communicative public speaking skills, and good taste. The speech
                        should not resemble a night club act, an impersonation, or comic dialogue. Audio-visual aids may
                        or may not be used to supplement and reinforce the message. Minimal notes are permitted.

                        Debate unlike speech involves the clashing of two opposing views at the same time. Both debate
                        events we participate in are limited preparation like the extemp and impromptu events. Topics
                        for each debate are decided by a strike process anywhere between 15-30 minutes before the round
                        starts. To practice for debate the team has weekly practice sessions where teammates debate each
                        other. Topics in debate can range from silly like, “This house believes TikTok is better than
                        Vine” to more serious, “This house believes that capital punishment is moral” and everything in
                        between. More detailed information on rules and procedures in each event than can be found here

                        Parliamentary debate is a two versus two debate that lasts from 45 minutes to an hour. This form
                        of debate focuses more on debate technique and terminology than delivery style. Each team has 15
                        minutes after strike to create their case. This form of debate has its roots in British
                        Parliamentary procedure with some adaptations.

                        IPDA is a one versus one debate that lasts around 30 minutes. This form of debate focuses more
                        on delivery style than it does on debate technique and terminology. Each debater has 20-30
                        minutes, depending on the tournament, to create their case. This form of debate is meant to
                        better simulate real life debate scenarios where both argumentation and delivery are considered.
